This directory contains:

- `train_gpt2_1d.chpl`: This is the initial port from the original. It does
  _not_ reflect how this code should be implemented in Chapel. However, it is
  much closer to the logic in the C reference. While this makes things harder to
  implement in Chapel sometimes, it has also helped to have faster initial
  implementation and debugging cycles.
